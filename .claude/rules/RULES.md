## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Code Review Rule for f1_data.py

**ANY logic changes to `shared/telemetry/f1_data.py` REQUIRE independent code review by an expert agent BEFORE committing.**

This rule exists because f1_data.py is the core telemetry processing hub - a single logic error can cause silent data corruption affecting all race replays.

👉 **See:** [`docs/DEVELOPMENT/f1-data-review-rule.md`](../../docs/DEVELOPMENT/f1-data-review-rule.md)

**Before modifying f1_data.py logic:**
1. Make the change
2. Invoke specialized code review agent
3. Get APPROVED status from review agent
4. Create risk assessment document
5. Reference review document in commit message

This is not optional. Do not bypass this rule.

## Core Development Rules

1. **Documentation Minimalism** - Only write critical documentation. No unnecessary docs.
2. **No Code Comments** - Code should be self-explanatory. No comments in code.
3. **Clean Commit Messages** - No Claude Code attribution. Keep commits focused on changes only.
4. **User-Driven Docs** - Only create documents if specifically asked for by user.

## Documentation Organization Rule ⭐

**CRITICAL: All documents MUST be properly organized in the `docs/` folder structure.**

### When Creating Documentation:

1. **Always use `docs/` folder as root** for all documentation
2. **Create a feature/feature-specific subfolder** inside `docs/` for related documents
3. **Never put docs at project root** (except README.md and CLAUDE.md which are already established)
4. **Group related docs together** in same subfolder with clear naming

### Folder Structure Pattern:

```
docs/
├── README.md                    # Index of all docs (optional, if helpful)
├── FEATURE-A/
│   ├── overview.md              # Feature description
│   ├── implementation.md         # How it works
│   ├── troubleshooting.md        # Common issues
│   └── examples.md              # Usage examples
├── FEATURE-B/
│   ├── guide.md
│   └── api.md
├── DEBUG/
│   ├── leaderboard-issues.md
│   └── performance-tips.md
├── archive/
│   ├── phase-reports/
│   └── old-docs/
└── plans/
    ├── implementation-plans/
    └── design-docs/
```

### Examples of Proper Organization:

**WRONG:**
```
project-root/
├── README.md
├── LEADERBOARD-DEBUG.md ❌
├── WEBSOCKET-GUIDE.md ❌
├── PERFORMANCE-TIPS.md ❌
└── docs/
    └── (scattered, no structure)
```

**RIGHT:**
```
docs/
├── LEADERBOARD/
│   ├── debugging.md
│   ├── position-tracking.md
│   └── accuracy-issues.md
├── WEBSOCKET/
│   ├── guide.md
│   ├── frame-streaming.md
│   └── connection-issues.md
├── PERFORMANCE/
│   ├── optimization-tips.md
│   ├── caching-strategy.md
│   └── benchmarking.md
└── archive/
    └── old-reports/
```

### When to Create New Subfolders:

- **Feature Documentation** → `docs/FEATURE-NAME/`
- **Bug Analysis/Debugging** → `docs/DEBUG/feature-specific-subfolder/`
- **Implementation Plans** → `docs/plans/`
- **Historical/Archive Docs** → `docs/archive/category/`
- **API/Reference** → `docs/API/` or `docs/FEATURE-NAME/api.md`
- **Guides & Tutorials** → `docs/GUIDES/topic/`
- **Technical Specifications** → `docs/SPECS/feature/`

### Naming Conventions:

- **Folders:** UPPERCASE with hyphens if multi-word (e.g., `LEADERBOARD`, `WEBSOCKET`, `DEBUG`)
- **Files:** lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `debugging.md`, `position-tracking.md`, `api-reference.md`)
- **Index files:** Use `README.md` or `index.md` as folder entry points
- **Date-stamped docs:** Not needed (use git history), unless specifically archiving a milestone

### Before Writing Any Document:

Ask yourself:
1. ✅ Is this document necessary? (rule #1 - minimalism)
2. ✅ What feature/topic does it cover?
3. ✅ Which existing folder should it go in, or should I create a new one?
4. ✅ What is the clearest filename?
5. ✅ Should it be in `docs/`, root-level, or inline in code?

### Current Approved Root-Level Docs:

Only these may exist at project root:
- ✅ `README.md` - Main entry point (DO NOT MOVE)
- ✅ `CLAUDE.md` - Developer guide (DO NOT MOVE)

Everything else goes in `docs/` with proper subfolder organization.

### Cleanup & Validation Rule:

**When moving or cleaning up documents, ALWAYS validate if they're still valid or should be archived.**

#### Step-by-Step Cleanup Process:

1. **Identify docs to clean up** - Find docs at project root or scattered in docs/
2. **Validate each document:**
   - ✅ **Still relevant?** - Is this still accurate and used?
   - ✅ **Related to active features?** - Is the feature still being worked on?
   - ✅ **Up-to-date?** - Does content match current code/implementation?
   - ✅ **Referenced anywhere?** - Are other docs or code linking to it?
3. **Decide action for each:**
   - **If VALID & CURRENT:** Move to appropriate `docs/[FEATURE]/` folder
   - **If OUTDATED but HISTORICAL:** Move to `docs/archive/[category]/` with reason
   - **If NO LONGER RELEVANT:** Delete entirely (not needed)
4. **Update links:**
   - Update all internal links in other docs
   - Update README.md with new locations
   - Check for references in CLAUDE.md
5. **Document the decision:**
   - Add brief note about why archived (if applicable)
   - Or mention in commit what was removed/reorganized

#### Archive Decision Guide:

**Archive to `docs/archive/` if:**
- ✓ Document was part of a completed phase (e.g., phase reports)
- ✓ Feature was implemented but no longer actively developed
- ✓ Contains historical analysis or old decisions
- ✓ Useful for reference but not actively maintained
- ✓ Debugging a past issue (no longer relevant to current code)

**Delete if:**
- ✗ Information is now outdated and inaccurate
- ✗ Feature was completely abandoned/removed
- ✗ Duplicate of current documentation
- ✗ Instructions reference old project structure
- ✗ Contains debug info for resolved issues

**Keep in active docs if:**
- ✓ Still referenced by current features
- ✓ Instructions apply to current code
- ✓ Part of ongoing development
- ✓ Users/collaborators need this info
- ✓ Actively maintained and updated

#### Archive Naming:

When moving docs to archive, use descriptive folder names:
- `archive/phase-reports/` - Old phase completion reports
- `archive/legacy-features/` - Features that were removed
- `archive/debug-sessions/` - Past debugging sessions (archived when issue closed)
- `archive/old-designs/` - Design docs for abandoned approaches
- `archive/[FEATURE]-deprecated/` - Feature no longer in use

#### Validation Checklist for Each Doc:

Before moving/archiving a document, ask:

- [ ] Does this document apply to the current codebase?
- [ ] Would a new collaborator need this information?
- [ ] Are there any links in other docs pointing to this?
- [ ] Is the information still accurate?
- [ ] Is this feature/topic still actively being worked on?
- [ ] If outdated, is it still useful as historical reference?
- [ ] Could this be merged with other related documentation?
- [ ] Should this be updated instead of archived?

#### Adding Archive Notes:

When archiving a document, add a note at the top:

```markdown
> **📦 Archived: [Date]**
>
> This document is archived because: [reason]
>
> For current information, see: [link to current doc or feature]
```

Example:
```markdown
> **📦 Archived: December 2025**
>
> This debugging guide is archived because the position calculation issue
> was fixed in v1.2.0. The leaderboard now uses improved smoothing.
>
> For current leaderboard info, see: docs/LEADERBOARD/guide.md
```

### Git Commit Message for Docs:

```
docs: add [feature] documentation in docs/[folder]/

- Added docs/FEATURE-NAME/file.md
- Organized related docs in subfolder
```

Or for cleanup/archival:

```
docs: organize and validate documentation

- Moved FEATURE-A docs to docs/FEATURE-A/
- Archived outdated debugging guides to docs/archive/debug-sessions/
- Updated all internal links in docs/README.md
- Removed duplicate documentation

Validation: Checked each doc for relevance to current codebase
```

### Documentation Lifecycle:

```
Created → Active → Maintained → Outdated → Archived → (Deleted if truly unused)
```

- **Active:** Referenced, up-to-date, actively maintained
- **Maintained:** Accurate but not frequently changed
- **Outdated:** Information is stale but historically useful
- **Archived:** In docs/archive/, marked with reason
- **Deleted:** No longer needed, completely removed
